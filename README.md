## ðŸ§  ML Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collected weekly USD-INR exchange rates using `yfinance`, and imported gold prices from CSV.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, merged, and scaled data using `StandardScaler`.
3. **Modeling**: Trained a Linear Regression model, tuned with `RandomizedSearchCV`.
4. **Deployment**: Built a Gradio interface for real-time prediction.
